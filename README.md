Setp-By-Step:
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Type in a command in order to scan a public test server. You will also be able to see a list of open ports and services.
3. Scan a device on your network. For example, 192.168.1.1, replace it with the IP of your router or any other device. This will show what is running and which ports are open.
4. Attempt a more so detailed scan. For example, -A 192.168.1.1. It adds os detection, service versions, and etc. This is good if you want to see what a full scan looks like.
5. This one is an optiional GUI but using Zenmap. This is an alternative to typing in commands and is most definetly useful for beginners or anyone do would rather have a visual layout over a command layout. While Zenmap may seem convenient, you also have to take in account that the command line that Nmap uses is a lot faster and better, especially for the users who are more advanced.
